# NextSignalOracle - A Versatile Signal Aggregation and Dissemination Framework

NextSignalOracle is a robust and adaptable framework designed to aggregate diverse data signals from various sources and disseminate them in a standardized and reliable manner. It provides a modular architecture for integrating with different data providers, applying custom processing logic, and delivering consolidated signals to consuming applications. This framework aims to simplify the complexity of building and maintaining signal processing pipelines, reducing development time and improving the overall reliability of data-driven systems.

The core purpose of NextSignalOracle is to abstract away the complexities associated with dealing with disparate data formats, unreliable data sources, and the need for consistent signal representation. It enables developers to focus on the specific logic of their applications rather than the underlying infrastructure required to obtain and process the necessary data. By providing a unified interface for accessing aggregated signals, the framework promotes code reusability and simplifies the integration of new data sources and processing algorithms.

This framework excels in scenarios where real-time data analysis, automated decision-making, or predictive modeling are essential. Whether you are building a financial trading platform, a smart city infrastructure management system, or an advanced anomaly detection application, NextSignalOracle provides the foundation for building robust and scalable data-driven solutions. Its modular design allows for easy extension and customization, ensuring that it can adapt to the evolving needs of your project.

Key benefits include reduced development overhead, improved data reliability, simplified integration of new data sources, and enhanced scalability. The framework's comprehensive documentation and well-defined API facilitate rapid prototyping and deployment, allowing you to quickly iterate on your solutions and bring them to market faster. By leveraging NextSignalOracle, you can unlock the full potential of your data and gain a competitive edge in today's data-driven world.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Data Source Integration:** Supports integration with various data sources through configurable adapters. Each adapter is responsible for fetching data from a specific source, transforming it into a standardized format, and providing it to the core processing pipeline. Currently supports JSON and CSV data streams.
*   **Configurable Signal Aggregation:** Offers a flexible engine for defining aggregation rules based on multiple input signals. Rules are defined using a declarative configuration format, allowing for easy modification and experimentation. The aggregation engine supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and custom JavaScript functions for more complex transformations.
*   **Real-time Data Processing:** Processes incoming data streams in real-time, providing immediate access to aggregated signals. The framework utilizes asynchronous processing techniques to ensure low latency and high throughput.
*   **Data Validation and Error Handling:** Implements robust data validation mechanisms to ensure data quality and prevent errors from propagating through the system. Validation rules can be customized for each data source and signal type. Includes comprehensive error logging and reporting capabilities.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Designed for scalability, allowing it to handle high volumes of data and a large number of concurrent users. The framework can be deployed across multiple servers to distribute the workload and improve performance.
*   **API for Signal Access:** Provides a well-defined API for accessing aggregated signals. The API supports both synchronous and asynchronous access patterns, allowing for integration with a wide range of applications. The API is documented using JSDoc and auto-generated documentation is provided.
*   **TypeScript Implementation:** Written in TypeScript, providing type safety and improved code maintainability. TypeScript's strong typing system helps prevent errors and ensures code consistency.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language, providing type safety and improved code maintainability.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing the TypeScript code.
*   **npm (Node Package Manager):** Used for managing project dependencies.
*   **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for creating the API endpoints.
*   **Jest:** A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
*   **ESLint:** A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/uhsr/NextSignalOracle.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd NextSignalOracle

3.  Install the dependencies:
    npm install

## Configuration

The framework uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and define the following variables:

*   `PORT`: The port number for the API server (default: 3000).
*   `DATA_SOURCE_URL`: URL for the data source (e.g., a REST API endpoint or a CSV file path). For multiple data sources, you might need to define multiple environment variables like `DATA_SOURCE_URL_1`, `DATA_SOURCE_URL_2`, etc.
*   `AGGREGATION_RULES_PATH`: Path to the JSON file containing the aggregation rules.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).

Example `.env` file:
PORT=3000
DATA_SOURCE_URL=https://example.com/data
AGGREGATION_RULES_PATH=./config/aggregation_rules.json
LOG_LEVEL=info

## Usage

1.  Start the development server:
    npm run dev

2.  Access the API endpoints:
    *   `GET /signals`: Returns the aggregated signals. Example: `curl http://localhost:3000/signals`

The aggregation rules are defined in a JSON file specified by the `AGGREGATION_RULES_PATH` environment variable. The format of the aggregation rules file is as follows:

{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "aggregatedSignal1",
      "expression": "signal1 + signal2 * 0.5"
    },
    {
      "name": "aggregatedSignal2",
      "expression": "customFunction(signal3, signal4)"
    }
  ],
  "customFunctions": {
    "customFunction": "function customFunction(a, b) { return a * a + b * b; }"
  }
}
